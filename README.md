## Notebooks
You can download and recreate these notebooks in your preferred programming environment. 

## NB
The cats_dogs-DATA notebook has information on how to deal with pickled datasets. A concept I struggled with for a while.

## More Information
I learnt how to do this from: 
- Deep Learning with Python, Francois Chollet (https://github.com/TabithaKO/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks)
- Understanding Convolutionsl Neural Networks (https://medium.com/@RaghavPrabhu/understanding-of-convolutional-neural-network-cnn-deep-learning-99760835f148)
- Loading your own data (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-3vuBynnOE&t=140s)

## Future Work
I plan to do some more CNN implementations that I will add to this repo
